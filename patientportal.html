          <h2>Web Application</h2>
          <h1>Patient Portal</h1>
          <p> Custom web application for a Physical Therapy Home Health agency. The application allowed the agency to
            better manage their patients so they can focus on providing exceptional care. </p>

              <h1>Dated application with inefficient workflow</h1>
              <p>Aside from being dated and slow, the application required many unecessary steps to complete certain
                tasks. Adding new pateints required several fields unrelated to the agency and scheduling visits was an
                inefficient process. Communication between the office staff and field therapist were also coordinated
                manually over the telephone since the system lacked proper notifications. Moreover, the old system was
                very confusing to use and it was difficult onboarding new therapist. </p>

              <h1>Modern application tailored to the client</h1>
              <p>I developed a new patient management portal to address the agency's needs. Working hand-in-hand with
                the agency, I gathered requirements to thoroughly understand their struggles and build a solution that
                would streamline their entire patient care process. The custom-tailored application was loaded with
                features that improved all aspects of their business: from patient intake and scheduling to
                documentation and billing. Having a simpler and more streamlined solution greatly enhanced the agencyâ€™s
                efficiency, allowing them to focus on providing exceptional patient care.</p>
