          <h2>Web & Mobile Application</h2>
          <h1>Route Sheet Portal</h1>
          <p>I developed a custom web and mobile application that digitized a paper form used by a Physical Therapy
            agency.</p>

              <h1>Paper forms were unmanagable</h1>
              <p>A Physical Therapy agency presented me a problem they were having with a paper form their employees
                were using to track patient home visits (called "route sheets"). These route sheets were signed by the
                patient for each therapy session performed by the therapist, which were then physically mailed to the
                agency's office. Forms were then placed in filing cabinets for retention. This process resulted in many
                lost and delayed route sheets, and finding past route sheets was a very time consuming task. </p>

              <h1>Digital forms with centralized location</h1>
              <p>I created a web application to digitize the route sheets and provide a centralized location for all
                submitted sheets. The application incorporated a responsive design, allowing therapist to capture the
                patient's signature during the visit directly from their mobile phone. Additionally, users were given
                the ability to sort, filter, and search route sheets within the application allowing them to quickly
                find submitted route sheets when needed.</p>
